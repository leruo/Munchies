Munchies üçÄSouth Africa's very own and a global first, is a food share app, what that entails it allows young and aspiring chefs and cooks to turn their living space into a virtual kitchen allowing them to share their food and confectionery dreams with the world. 

This is achieved by allowing young cooks and chefs to be given a space to sell their culinary creations with anyone close by.

Munchies does this by connecting cooks and users virtually on the app to allow for their creations to be bought and sold. Creating a completely revolutionary way to experience food, flavours and people.

We at Munchies need your help to secure funding to allow us to develop, test and launch the app for the first time on our shores in South Africa.

 I thank you, we can't wait to experience a new way of getting home cooked meals and sweets on the fly anywhere at any time. Munchies!
